# iREPA Project Page - Summary

## What was created

A professional, clean project page for your paper "What matters for Representation Alignment: Global Information or Spatial Structure?" based on the Cambrian template.

## Key Features

### 1. **Prominent Key Takeaways**
Three main findings are displayed prominently with custom styling:
- Higher Validation Accuracy ≠ Better Generation
- Spatial Structure Drives Performance
- Accentuating Spatial Features Improves Convergence

### 2. **Sections Included**
- **Header**: Title, authors, affiliations, and action buttons (arXiv, PDF, Code)
- **Abstract**: Clear, concise summary of the work
- **Key Takeaways**: 3 main findings in styled boxes
- **Motivation**: Why global information matters less (with figures)
- **Spatial Structure Analysis**: SSM metric and correlation results
- **Method (iREPA)**: Your spatial regularization approach
- **Results**: Convergence plots and key findings
- **Conclusion**: Summary and impact
- **BibTeX**: Citation information

### 3. **Figures Included**
All key figures from your paper assets:
- Teaser figure
- Controlled experiments (SAM2, CLS token mixing)
- Spatial structure correlation plots
- Convergence curves
- Comparison visualizations

### 4. **Professional Design**
- Based on Cambrian template (proven, clean design)
- Custom CSS for key takeaways section
- Interactive figures with zoom capability
- Responsive design (works on mobile and desktop)
- Research-focused tone (no hyperbole)

## How to View Locally

```bash
cd docs/project_page
./serve.sh
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd docs/project_page
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

## Image Generation with Flux

The project page is designed to use Flux-generated images for visual appeal:

1. **Hero Image** (header): See `FLUX_PROMPTS.md` for detailed prompts
2. **Teaser Figure** (main highlight): Already included from paper (teaser-v2.png)
3. **Optional Icons**: Can replace numbered circles with custom icons

**Important**: The teaser figure from your paper (`teaser-v2.png`) is now prominently displayed as Figure 1 right after the abstract, before the Key Takeaways section. This is the main visual that explains your core finding.

To generate the hero image:
```bash
# See FLUX_PROMPTS.md for complete instructions
# Quick: Use https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-schnell
# Then save as: docs/project_page/static/img/hero-image.png
```

## Next Steps

### Before Publishing:

1. **Update Links** in `index.html`:
   - Line ~52: arXiv link
   - Line ~57: PDF link
   - Line ~62: GitHub code link
   - Author links in byline section (if you want personal pages)

2. **Review Content**:
   - Check all text matches your final paper
   - Verify all figures are correct
   - Test all links

3. **Test**:
   - View on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Check responsive design on mobile
   - Verify all images load correctly
   - Test zoom functionality on figures

4. **Deploy**:
   - Upload to GitHub Pages, or
   - Upload to your institutional server, or
   - Use any static site hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

### Optional Enhancements:

If you want to add more:
- **Video/Demo**: Add a section with demo videos if available
- **Interactive Plots**: Add interactive visualizations (like Cambrian's tuning_recipes_plot.html)
- **More Comparisons**: Add more detailed comparison tables if desired
- **Qualitative Results**: Add more qualitative visualizations

## Design Philosophy

Following your requirements:
- **Clean and professional**: Minimal, research-focused design
- **No hyperbole**: Objective, to-the-point language
- **Key takeaways clear**: 3 findings prominently displayed with custom styling
- **Figures support claims**: All major figures from paper included
- **Based on Cambrian**: Uses proven template structure and aesthetics
