    Abstract 3D visualization of AI representation alignment concept.
    Left side: chaotic scattered glowing particles in blue tones representing unstructured "global information",
    floating randomly in space with weak connections.
    Right side: precise geometric grid of interconnected nodes in purple/violet tones representing organized "spatial structure",
    forming a perfect lattice with strong local connections.
    Center: flowing energy streams connecting the two sides, showing alignment process.
    Deep gradient background from midnight blue to deep purple.
    Volumetric lighting, depth, modern tech aesthetic.
    Cinematic, high-quality 3D render style. No text, no people.
    Clean, professional, suitable for research paper hero image.

hero_image_alt:
  name: "Hero Image (Alternative)"
  output_file: "hero_alt"
  dimensions: "16:9"
  prompt: |
    Abstract scientific visualization contrasting two AI concepts:
    Left: chaotic scattered dots in blue representing unstructured global information,
    Right: precise geometric grid in purple representing organized spatial structure.
    Flowing connections between them. Deep blue to purple gradient background.
    Ultra-clean, modern, high-tech illustration. No text, no people, minimalist.

icon_accuracy:
  name: "Takeaway Icon 1 - Accuracy Paradox"
  output_file: "icon_accuracy_paradox"
  dimensions: "1:1"  # Square
  prompt: |
    Minimalist icon showing a broken correlation between accuracy and performance.
    Simple geometric design: an upward arrow that breaks and curves down, or a checkmark with a question mark overlay.
    Purple (#764ba2) and blue (#667eea) gradient.
    Clean, modern, flat design style. Perfect square composition.
    Suitable for research presentation. No text, very simple and clear.
