# Quick Start Guide

## Current Status ‚úÖ

‚úÖ Project page structure created
‚úÖ Teaser figure from paper prominently displayed as Figure 1
‚úÖ All paper figures copied and organized
‚úÖ 3 Key Takeaways styled and ready
‚úÖ Professional design based on Cambrian template

## What You See Now

1. **Header**: Title + Authors + Action buttons (placeholder links)
2. **Abstract**: Your paper's abstract
3. **üéØ Figure 1 (TEASER)**: Your main teaser-v2.png - prominently displayed with detailed caption
4. **Key Takeaways**: 3 main findings in styled boxes
5. **Sections**: Motivation, Spatial Structure Analysis, Method, Results, Conclusion
6. **Footer**: BibTeX citation

## View It Now

```bash
cd docs/project_page
./serve.sh
```

Then open: http://localhost:8000

## The Teaser Figure

**Location in page**: Right after abstract, before Key Takeaways
**File used**: `static/img/teaser-v2.png` (from your paper)
**Why here**: This is your main visual that explains the core finding - it deserves prime real estate!

The teaser includes:
- Visual comparison of spatial structure vs global information
- Your key metrics (correlation values)
- Clear demonstration that spatial structure matters more

## Optional: Add Hero Image with Flux

If you want a decorative hero image in the header (next to title):

1. See `FLUX_PROMPTS.md` for generation prompts
2. Generate using Flux: https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-schnell
3. Save as: `docs/project_page/static/img/hero-image.png`
4. Edit `index.html` line ~73, remove `style="display: none;"`

**Note**: This is optional and decorative. The teaser from your paper is already the main visual highlight.

## Before Deployment

### Must Do:
1. ‚úèÔ∏è Update links in `index.html`:
   - Line ~50: arXiv URL
   - Line ~56: PDF URL
   - Line ~62: Code/GitHub URL

2. üëÅÔ∏è Review content matches your final paper

3. üß™ Test locally (already done above)
